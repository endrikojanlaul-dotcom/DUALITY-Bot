- User-generated content: suggestions, bug reports, messages sent to the Bot (these may be persisted or forwarded to configured channels for triage).
- Logs and metadata: timestamps, command usage, and basic diagnostic logs for debugging and support.

3. How we use your data

4. Legal basis
- Where applicable, processing is based on your consent (e.g., linking Roblox username) or the legitimate interest of the Owner in providing and securing the service.

5. Data sharing
- Discord: The Bot interacts with Discord APIs and your Discord account data is visible to the Bot according to your Discord privacy settings and the bot's granted intents.
- Service providers: The Owner may use hosting, database, or analytics providers. Those providers process data on behalf of the Owner and are subject to their own terms.
- No sale: We do not sell personal data.

6. Data retention

- Bug reports, suggestions, and logs may be retained for an administrative period (configurable by the Owner).

7. Data security
- The Bot uses reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data (database access controls, minimal privileges). However, no system is fully secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.
